Ultimate Proxy Checker written in Python 3.8 with only standard library modules.

The script by itself generates all neccessary data points in a "etc" folder. Contents:
                                                                                proxies.txt
                                                                                config.ini
                                                                                README.md
                                                                                
It also writes a default configuration into config.ini, along with a custom message into a README file, but I'd reccommend to change at least the host being used for measurements inside config.ini.


Thank you if you use it, enjoy! :)
